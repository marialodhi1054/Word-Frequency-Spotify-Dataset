from, I'm running from the emptiness We can't go back to the way that we used to love Walking through the door of this old and lonely Place that used to feel like us Remembering the only thing that made me Feel like I was worth the love We used to hold hands, now I dance alone We had Springsteen playing so loud We danced in the dark till it felt like home With you, home was anywhere But you will never be left behind Give me a moment, I need just a little more time If I could, I would have made things right We can't go back to the way that we used to love Never apart you're still running through my blood We can't go back to the way that we used to love We can't go back to the way that we used to love We can't go back to the way that we used to– Be talking through the night, you laying by my side You were always there to heal my scars And into the dawn I do my best to try and find some sleep But you still keep me up We used to hold hands, now I dance alone We had Springsteen playing so loud We danced in the dark till it felt like home With you, home was anywhere But you will never be left behind Give me a moment, I need just a little more time If I could, I would have made things right We can't go back to the way that we used to love Never apart you're still running through my blood We can't go back to the way that we used to love We can't go back to the way that we used to– But I can't escape, you're still in my head I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness But I can't escape, you're still in my head I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness But I can't escape, you're still in my head I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness But I can't escape, you're still in my head I'm running from, I'm running from the emptiness We can't go back to the
